        <h2 class="border">The Long Story</h2>

        <p>Iâ€™ve been designing for decades, studying art (BFA, Drawing & Painting) back when the Steves were building computers in their garage. After university, I worked in a Chicago print production studio kerning type via X-Acto blade for ad agencies. My first computer was a Commodore 64, on which I created raster â€˜paintingsâ€™. Back then, cmd + z was good for only a single undo! Still, I was determined to work with the new technology, and soon became the first â€˜Computer Graphics Designerâ€™ at Hewitt Associates (now Aon). There, in addition to design duties, I was tasked with beta testing the $150K graphics computer. That behemoth was so fussy and prone to overheating, it required its own climate-controlled office!</p>

          <p><strong>ephemera</strong> <span>|É™Ëˆfem(É™)rÉ™|</span><br/>
          pl. noun</p>
          <p><em>things that exist or are used or enjoyed for only a short time</em></p>
        </aside>

        <p>Following Hewitt, I moved to a Chicago branding/package design studio where we worked with Illustrator & Quark. When I stayed home raising children (3) I kept up with technology as a freelancer & volunteer designing ads, collateral, logos, newsletters, etc. When the Internet graduated from dial-up, I learned HTML/CSS. What fun! CSS was akin to having all the paint colors w/o the smell of turpentine! I built my own site, then a few more and eventually picked up clients across the country designing & building WordPress sites, apps & digital products.</p>
        <p>Now, I struggle with how to label myself. 'Designer' is too vague. 'Web Designer' is so last decade. 'UI/UX Designer' is confusing and often misused. 'Product Designer' isn't bad. But all these titles omit the <em>developer</em> part of my skillset. And I love the development part just as much as the design partâ€“can't imagine doing one without the other. So, I guess <em>Devsigner</em> or <em>Unicorn</em> could work. But, my fav is <em>Digital Ephemera Chef</em>. I coined this title because so much of the work I've cooked up is gone...poof! Ephemera. And I'm OK with that. ðŸ˜‰</p>
